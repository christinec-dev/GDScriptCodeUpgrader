# Code Upgrader Plugin
Code Upgrader is a tool designed to help upgrade your GDScript code from Godot 3 to Godot 4. This plugin automates the process of updating deprecated methods, properties, and syntax, ensuring your projects are compatible with the latest version of Godot. 

### Instructions 
- Download the plugin and enable it.
- If enabled correctly, there should be a new dock on the left side of the editor.
- This dock has two parts: a code input and an output panel.
- We will paste our Godot 3 code in the input panel, and copy our Godot 4 code from the output panel.
- Press execute and your code should be converted!
