# Code Upgrader Plugin
Code Upgrader is a tool designed to help upgrade your GDScript code from Godot 3 to Godot 4. This plugin automates the process of updating deprecated methods, properties, and syntax, ensuring your projects are compatible with the latest version of Godot.

## Notice 
Please know that I might not have picked up all the changes, as there are a lot, so if you find ones that I haven’t added, you can let me know and I will implement those fixes into the plugin!

## Usage Instructions 
- Download the plugin and enable it.
- If enabled correctly, there should be a new dock on the left side of the editor.
- This dock has two parts: a code input and an output panel.
- We will paste our Godot 3 code in the input panel, and copy our Godot 4 code from the output panel.
- Press execute and your code should be converted!
